{{< greetings >}} Greetings!

I'm Muhammad Rizqi Assabil

I specialize in Linux systems, specifically 
- Automation
- Increasing productivity with various shell scripts, wm hotkeys, and open source applications
- Troubleshooting
- Some knowledge of linux security best practices
- Being good at the command line in general

I have also successfully installed Gentoo to a baremetal machine at one point.

It's been roughly 3 years since I last switch fulltime to linux (Arch btw). If you need a DevOps or a Sysadmin guy, hit me up :3

I also have interests in Machine Learning field, Data Science/Analytics world, and I'm also capable of creating backend for applications.

One last thing, I also have this site hosted on my baremetal machine. Do come visit ^^ (If it's down, you can blame PLN)
